My .bashrc
=========
A project for a pretty and functional .bashrc file. 
---------------------------------------------------

This is not my entirely my work. I found most of it on the web. 
The main contributors are going to be listed below. If I have missed someone or someone does not want his work to be 
published here. Just email me. 

Feel free to contribute.

Some functions have been aliased. In order to temporary use the original command use a backslash in front of the command.
For example using `tree` will print out a colorized tree.
In escape that simple use - `\tree`

`syslog` - Will show you a live colorized tail-list of the system events. <br/>
